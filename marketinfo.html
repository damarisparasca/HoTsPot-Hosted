    <div class="section">
        <p>This tool uses optimization models to compute the optimal production levels and emission reductions for each farm. In the market-based system, we used Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints(Hu & Chen, 2019), applied Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) transformation to convert the profit maximization problem of each farm into sets of constraints. In the government-regulated system, the optimization problem is solved using quadratic programming. The detailed calculation methods are shown below.</p>

        <p>The objective function (1) represents the profit of each farm. It contains four components, i.e. livestock revenue, production cost, emission reduction cost and the revenue or cost of selling or purchasing WaterCredits. Due to the lack of detailed cost data for each specific emission reduction measure, we introduced an emission reduction cost coefficient \(k\) to estimate the cost associated with each percentage of nitrogen reduction. Emission reduction cost \(k \theta_i^2\) reflects the increasing marginal abatement costs by using the quadratic term, where costs rise with the square of the reduction rate. The \(\sum_{j \neq i} x_{ij} - \sum_{j \neq i} x_{ji}\) represent the net WaterCredits sold (positive) or purchased (negative) by farm i.</p>
        
        <p>The constraint (2) ensures that farms comply with the WaterCredits trading mechanism. When the nitrogen emission of farm i is lower than the baseline level, equation (2) will force \(\sum_{j\neq i}x_{ij}-\sum_{j\neq i}x_{ji}\) it to be positive, which means that the farm sells WaterCredits. Conversely, when the nitrogen emission of farm i is higher than the emission baseline, \(\sum_{j\neq i}x_{ij}-\sum_{j\neq i}x_{ji}\) will be negative, indicating that the farm must purchase WaterCredits. The constraint (3) shows the feasible bound for the reduction rate \(\theta_{i}\) and trading variable \(x_{ij}\). The constraint (4) shows the bound of credit sales, there is no credit sales without production. The constraint (5) shows the lower and upper bound of the amount of cows allowed in the farm, to prevent farms from only selling WaterCredits without producing, or having an unreasonable amount of cows. The constraint (6) is market cleaning constraint, to make sure that the total amount of sold Watercredits in the market equals to the total amount of bought Watercredits.</p>
        
        <p>As the objective function is convex and continuous on decision variables \(\theta_{i},x_{ij},q_{i},P_{N}\), the above optimization problem can be solved by applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To derive these conditions, we construct the Lagrangian function (7).</p>
